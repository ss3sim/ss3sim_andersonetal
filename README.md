   in.

3. Download the file
   [`ss3sim-ms.pdf`](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/254940/ss3sim-ms.pdf)
   and add comments. Then email me the edited version.

We are developing the appendix (an R vignette) in the file
`ss3sim-vignette.Rnw` in the `vignettes` folder.

If you have references to add, please add them in BibTeX format to the file
`refs.bib` (or send them to me).

Note that the lines in `ss3sim-ms.md` are wrapped approximately on phrases to make Git
diffs and merging easier. Don't worry too much about this as you edit, just try
and keep the line length approximately 80 characters or less and don't make
line break changes unless you need to.
