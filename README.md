To contribute, you have a few options:

1. Create a branch of this repository and edit the main manuscript file: `ss3sim-ms.md`. 
Let me (Sean) know afterwards by email or by starting an issue and I'll merge the changes in.

2. Download the file `ss3sim-ms.docx` and edit using track changes. 
Then email me the edited version or upload it back to the repository and let me know.

3. Download the file `ss3sim-ms.pdf` and add comments.
Then email me the edited version or upload it back to the repository and let me know.

The appendix (an R-vignette-style document) is being developed in the file `ss3sim-vignette.Rmd`.

If you have references to add, just add them in BibTeX format to the file `refs.bib` (or send them to me).
