# Abstract

# Introduction

Simulation is a critical component to testing fishery stock-assessment methods
[@hilborn1992]. With simulation, we can evaluate the precision and bias of
increasingly complex assessment methods (REF) in a controlled environment
where the true state of a fishery is known. Recently, simulation studies have
been key to improving methods to assess, for example, natural mortality (REF),
XX (REF), and XX (REF). (Possible refs: [@lee2011; @piner2011; @methot2011;
@jiao2012; @lee2012])

Stock Synthesis [SS; @methot2012], is a widely-used stock-assessment
framework. It implements a statistical catch-at-age Integrated Analysis
population dynamics models using a wide range of minimally-processed data
[@maunder2012; @methot2012]. By using this already-developed assessment
framework, those conducting stock assessments and peer reviewers can focus on
the underlying science, instead of the model code [@methot2012]. Owing to
these advantages, SS3 (the third version of the software) is one of the
world's most commonly-used stock-assessment tools, particularly on the west
coast of the United States and Australia, where it was used in 60?/XX (REF)
and XX/XX (REF) assessments in 2012.

While SS is increasingly the standard for fisheries stock assessment, and the
programming language R [@rcoreteam2013] has become the standard for
statistical computing and visualization (REF?), we lack a generalized
framework to link these components in a simulation context. Here, we introduce
ss3sim, an R package that facilitates large-scale, rapid, and reproducible
stock-assessment simulation with the widely-used SS framework. We begin by
outlining the general philosophy of ss3sim and describing its functions. We
then demonstrate the software by developing a simple example. We conclude by
discussing how ss3sim complements other stock assessment simulation software
and outlining research questions our accessible and general SS simulation
framework could address.

# The ss3sim framework

## Terminology

[TODO abbreviate this paragraph]
Throughout this paper we refer to a number of terms, which we define here. We
use the term *operating model* (OM) to refer to the model that represents the
underlying true dynamics of the system. We use the term *estimation model*
(EM) to refer to the model used to estimate quantities of interest. We use the
term *scenario* to refer to a combination of operating and estimation model
*cases*. For example, an OM case might specify that natural mortality follows
a random walk, an EM case might estimate a single parameter for natural
mortality, and the combination of these cases along with all other specified
conditions creates a scenario. We refer to *iterations* or *replicates* as
repeated simulations of a scenario, possibly with new process and observation
error added each time. A simulation therefore refers to the combination of all
scenarios and iterations.

## General philosophy

We designed ss3sim to be reproducible, flexible, and rapid. *Reproducible*:
ss3sim allows for the simulation to be documented in code and plain-text
control files. Further, the plain-text control files refer to individual
cases, which allows for the reuse of control files across scenarios. This
reduces the chance for errors and simplifies the exploration of new scenarios.

*Flexible*: ss3sim allows the user to specify their own OM and EM using all
the possible configurations of SS3. ss3sim returns output in standard
comma-separated-value (`.csv`). This means that the output can be easily
processed with the package-provided functions or with other tools.

*Rapid*: First, ss3sim relies on SS3, which uses ADMB as a backend
optimization platform --- the most rapid and robust optimization software
available [@fournier2012]. Second, ss3sim allows simulations to be deployed
across multiple computers or computer cores. Third, the package provides a
number of functions to quickly visualize simulation output. Access to quick
visualization tools means that users are more likely to graphically explore
their models and are therefore more likely to detect errors and understand
their simulation output as they introduce complexity. Finally, ss3sim
minimizes the amount of bookkeeping code that researchers have to write so
that they can concentrate on the science itself.

## General structure

An ss3sim simulation requires three types of input: (1) a base model of the
underlying truth (an SS3 OM), (2) a base model of how to assess that truth (an
SS3 EM), (3) and a set of case files describing deviations from these base
models. ss3sim works by converting case file arguments (e.g. a given natural
mortality trajectory) into manipulations of SS3 configuration files, running
the OM, sampling pseudo data, and running the EM, and storing the output
(Figure 1).

RE-WORK THIS:

## Low-level generic ss3sim functions

See Table 1 for a description of the main functions.
We show how the functions fit into the general structure of a stock assessment simulation in Figure 1.
ss3sim functions are divided into three types of functions:

1. Functions that manipulate SS configuration files. 
These manipulations generate an underlying "truth" (OM) and control our assessment of those models (EM).

2. Functions that conduct simulations. 
These functions generate a folder structure, call manipulation functions, run `SS3` as needed, and save the output.

3. Functions for analyzing and plotting simulation output.

## High-level tailored ss3sim functions

- `run_ss3sim` also see `run_fish600` for an example custom wrapper function for a specific set of projects
- because it relies on manipulation of these configuration files, it's important the config files match a specific format
- general framework, because you start with your own OM and EM, and a wide variety of questions are then available through manipulations of ..., ...

# An example simulation with ss3sim

(unsure how much of this will go in the main paper and how much will just be
in the appendix... probably many of these details should be appendix only with
just enough elements to give a flavour for what can be done in the main paper)

## Setting up the SS models

- choosing a specific conditioning model or generic conditioning type
- setting up the OM and EM SS models
- things to keep in mind
- running through SS to format as `.ss_new` files and renaming

## File and folder setup

- required files
- Why we chose a flat-file structure
- see vignette

## Translating research questions into configuration files

- the (simple) research question (increasing or decreasing survey effort
  crossed with estimating M or fixing M)
- indicate which arguments to adjust

## Deterministic model testing

- reduce recdevs, reduce sigma R, bias correction
- what to plot, what to look for, how good is OK?

## Output analysis and visualization

- examples using the included functions
- brief take home of what we'd conclude

# Discussion

- Other sections? 
- how we validated it
- benefit of using one well tested and well-understood modeling framework (SS)
  (but disadvantages too) --- i.e. benefit to playing with all the switches
  and understanding one framework well versus having many tools that we
  superficially understand (based on Rick's comments at the conference)
- why we developed generic low-level functions and higher level functions
- but researchers are free to develop their own higher level functions
- because in an open-source MIT(?) licensed R package, users are free to
  modify functions as needed

## How ss3sim complements other generic stock-assessment simulation software

- focus on "generic" software, e.g. not software the just works for salmon
  simulation

*r4ss*

- @r4ss2013
- r4ss has functions to facilitate aspects of simulations, mostly focused on
  reading and plotting output for stock assessment
- ss3sim uses r4ss functions for some reading, writing, and bias adjustment

*FLR*

- @kell2007 for FLR and @hillary2009 for simulation in FLR
- statistical catch-at-age only?
- not integrated analysis, not SS
- but particularly relevant to Europe

*"Hooilator"*

- http://fisherysimulation.codeplex.com, Windows only, GUI..., works on
  bootstrapped data only, therefore isn't as flexible as ss3sim. Used in:
    1. @lee2012
    2. @piner2011
    3. @lee2011

## Research opportunities with ss3sim

- there are lots, we should brainstorm some key ones
