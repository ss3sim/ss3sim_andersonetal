To contribute, you have a number of options in order of decreasing complexity
for you but increasing complexity for me:

1. [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), make
   your edits to `ss3sim-ms.md`, and submit a pull request on GitHub.

2. Create a branch of this repository and edit `ss3sim-ms.md`. Let me (Sean)
   know afterwards by email or by starting an issue and I'll merge the changes
   in.

3. Download the file
   [`ss3sim-ms.pdf`](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/254940/ss3sim-ms.pdf)
   and add comments. Then email me the edited version.

3. Download the file
   [`ss3sim-ms.docx`](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/254940/ss3sim-ms.docx)
   and edit using track changes. Then email me the edited version.

We are developing the appendix (an R-vignette-style document) in the file
`ss3sim-vignette.Rmd`.

If you have references to add, please add them in BibTeX format to the file
`refs.bib` (or send them to me).
