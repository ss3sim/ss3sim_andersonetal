Short title: ss3sim: Simulation with Stock Synthesis
<!--< 50 characters-->

# Abstract

Simulation is critical to testing fishery stock-assessment methods.
However, while the statistical age-structured population dynamics model Stock Synthesis (SS)
has become widely-used around the world, 
there lacks a generalized and scriptable framework to run SS simulations. 
Here, we introduce ss3sim, an R package that facilitates 
large-scale, rapid, and reproducible simulation with the third version of SS, SS3.
ss3sim requires only minor modifications to an existing SS3 model 
along with a set of plaintext control files describing 
alternative underlying states of nature, sampling scenarios,
and assessment scenarios.
ss3sim then generates an underlying truth, 
samples from that truth, 
runs the estimation model, 
and summarizes the results.
The package can simultaneously investigate multiple scenarios
and be run across multiple computers in parallel.
We demonstrate the software with a simple example, 
discuss how ss3sim complements other simulation software, 
and outline research questions that ss3sim could address.


# Introduction

Simulation is a critical component to testing fishery stock-assessment methods 
[@hilborn1987; @hilborn1992; @rosenberg1994; @peterman2004].
With simulation, we can evaluate the precision and bias of complex assessment methods 
in a controlled environment where we know the true state of nature [@hilborn1992].
Recently, simulation studies have been key to improving strategies for dealing with, 
for example, time-varying natural mortality [@lee2011; @jiao2012; @deroba2013], 
uncertainty in steepness of the stock-recruit relationship [@lee2012], 
and uncertainty in stock productivity [@ianelli2002].
[not necessarily the best examples]

Stock Synthesis [SS; @methot2013] is a widely-used stock-assessment framework.
It implements statistical age-structured population dynamics modeling
using a wide range of minimally-processed data [@maunder2013; @methot2013].
By using this framework, 
individuals conducting stock assessments and peer reviewers 
can focus on the underlying science, instead of the model code [@methot2013].
Owing to these advantages, SS3 (the third version of the software) 
is one of the world's most commonly-used stock-assessment tools, 
particularly in the United States and Australia, 
where it has been used in 35 and 12 stock assessments as of 2012, 
respectively [@methot2013].

Although SS is increasingly a standard for fisheries stock assessment, 
and the programming language R [@rcoreteam2013] has become the standard
for statistical computing and visualization, 
there lacks a generalized framework 
to link these components in a simulation context.
Here, we introduce ss3sim, 
an R package that facilitates 
large-scale, rapid, and reproducible simulation 
with the widely-used SS framework.
We begin by outlining the general structure of ss3sim 
and describing its functions.
We then demonstrate the software by developing a simple example.
We conclude by discussing how ss3sim complements other simulation software 
and outlining research questions 
our accessible and general SS simulation framework could address.

# The ss3sim framework

## Design goals of ss3sim

We designed ss3sim to be reproducible, flexible, and rapid.
*Reproducible*: ss3sim allows for the simulation to be documented 
in code and plain-text control files.
*Flexible*: ss3sim can implement all possible configurations of SS3.
Further, ss3sim summarizes the entire simulation into comma-separated-value (`.csv`) files
allowing for the output to be easily processed 
with the package-provided functions or with other tools.
*Rapid*: ss3sim relies on SS3, 
which uses ADMB as a backend optimization platform --- 
the most rapid and robust optimization software available [@fournier2012].
ss3sim also facilitates the deployment of simulations 
across multiple computers or computer cores, thereby accelerating computation.
Finally, the package provides a number of visualization functions 
to quickly explore simulation output.

## The general stucture of an ss3sim simulation

An ss3sim simulation requires three types of input: 
(1) a base model of the underlying truth, or operating model (OM); 
(2) a base model used to assess that truth, 
also known as the estimation model or method (EM); 
and (3) a set of plain text files (case files) 
describing deviations from these base models.
Each unique combination of OM, EM, and case files are referred to as scenarios. 
These scenarios are usually run for multiple iterations, 
possibly adding unique process and observation error each time.
A simulation therefore refers to the combination of all scenarios and iterations.

ss3sim works, in general, by converting case file arguments 
(e.g. arguments specifying a given natural mortality trajectory) 
into manipulations of SS3 configuration files (`change` functions); 
running the OM, sampling the time-series of population dynamics (pseudo data), 
and running the EM (`run` functions); 
and facilitating the manipulation and visualization of output 
(`get` and `plot` functions) (Figure 1).

# An example simulation with ss3sim

(unsure how much of this will go in the main paper and how much will just be in the appendix... 
probably many of these details should go in an appendix with just enough elements 
to give a flavour for what can be done in the main paper)

*Setting up the SS models*: 

- choosing a specific conditioning model or generic conditioning type
- setting up the OM and EM SS models
- things to keep in mind
- running through SS to format as `.ss_new` files and renaming
- required files

*Setting up the configuration files*:

- the (simple) research question (increasing or decreasing survey effort crossed with estimating M or fixing M)
- indicate which arguments to adjust

*Deterministic model testing*:

- reduce recdevs, reduce sigma R, bias correction
- what to plot, what to look for, how good is OK?

*Output analysis and visualization*:

- examples using the included functions
- brief take home of what we'd conclude

# How ss3sim complements other simulation software

Probably turn this into a small table:

*r4ss*

- @r4ss2013
- r4ss has functions to facilitate aspects of simulations, mostly focused on
  reading and plotting output for stock assessment
- ss3sim uses r4ss functions for some reading, writing, and bias adjustment

*FLR*

- @kell2007 for FLR and @hillary2009 for simulation in FLR
- statistical catch-at-age only?
- not integrated analysis, not SS
- but particularly relevant to Europe

*"Hooalator"*

- http://fisherysimulation.codeplex.com, Windows only, GUI..., works on
  bootstrapped data only, therefore isn't as flexible as ss3sim. Used in:
    1. @lee2012
    2. @piner2011
    3. @lee2011

# Research opportunities with ss3sim

- there are lots, we should brainstorm some key ones

# Conclusions

- benefit of using one well tested and well-understood modeling framework (SS) i.e. benefit to playing with all the switches and understanding one framework well versus having many tools that we superficially understand (based on Rick's comments at the conference)
- why we developed generic low-level functions and high-level functions
- researchers are free to develop their own low- and high-level functions because in an open-source MIT(?) licensed R package, users are free to modify functions as needed
- (these points are somewhat random at the moment)
